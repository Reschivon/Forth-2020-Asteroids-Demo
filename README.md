# Forth-2020-Asteroids-Demo

I used my Java variant of Forth to debug an Asteroids game written in pure Java for the May 5 2021 Forth2020 meeting. You can watch the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZg8VpIu3JI&t=4s)
The code is here for reference, and for the brave souls who intend to try it out

Do check out the [original project](https://github.com/Reschivon/RemoteJavaForth)
